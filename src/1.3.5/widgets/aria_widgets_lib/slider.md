Title: Slider

The touch slider widget is a skinnable single thumb slider (enhanced to support double thumbs in the future), which will be moveable using a touch gesture.

<script src='%SNIPPETS_SERVER_URL%/snippets/github.com/ariatemplates/documentation-code/snippets/widgets/touch/slider/Snippet.tpl?tag=mobileSlider2&lang=at&outdent=true' defer></script>

As you can see in the above code snippet, the width is a configurable attribute.

Even the output of the slider value can be redirected to a text widget as in the below code snippet. Here the Touch Slider Widget is bound with a Text Widget to display a value between $0 and $100 :

<script src='%SNIPPETS_SERVER_URL%/snippets/github.com/ariatemplates/documentation-code/snippets/widgets/touch/slider/Snippet.tpl?tag=mobileSlider1&lang=at&outdent=true' defer></script>
