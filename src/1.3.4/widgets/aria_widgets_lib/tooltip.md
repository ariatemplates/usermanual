* **Initial delay** - the delay after which the tooltip will be shown if the the mouse remains stationary over the element

* **Removal delay** - the delay after which the tooltip is removed, even if the mouse remains stationary

* **Reshow delay** - the delay after which the tooltip is displayed again if the user moves the mouse over an element and is supposed to be shorter than the initial delay

* **Timeframe** - the delay after which to show the tooltip is reset to the initial delay
