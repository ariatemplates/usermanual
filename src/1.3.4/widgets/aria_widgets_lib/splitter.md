Title: Splitter

A splitter widget allows users to split macros into panels. These panels can be resized by dragging.

A simple way to add Splitter widget to the application is as follows
<script src='%SNIPPETS_SERVER_URL%/snippets/github.com/ariatemplates/documentation-code/snippets/widgets/splitter/Splitter.tpl?tag=wgtSplitter&lang=at&outdent=true' defer></script>

The whole list of configuration parameters is available in [Splitter](http://ariatemplates.com/api/#aria.widgets.CfgBeans:SplitterCfg).
