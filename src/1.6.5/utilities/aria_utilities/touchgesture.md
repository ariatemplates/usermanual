Title: Touch and Gesture Events

Aria Templates allows the following Touch and Gesture Events `touchstart`, `touchmove`, `touchend`, `tap`, `swipe`

The simple way to add the above events on a div is as follows
<script src='%SNIPPETS_SERVER_URL%/snippets/github.com/ariatemplates/documentation-code/snippets/utils/touchevents/Snippet.tpl?tag=touchEvent&lang=at&outdent=true' defer></script>

TouchStart Sample Usage

###Click Buster
Aria Templates implements a click buster strategy to avoid the side effects of [ghost clicks](http://ariatemplates.com/blog/2014/05/ghost-clicks-in-mobile-browsers/).
Safetap event permits to handle the tap gesture without any side effects due to the ghost click, generated by the browsers in mobile devices.
If a mousedown, click or touchend event is detected after a safetap on the same area, it is ignored since it is considered as a ghost click: `preventDefault()` and `stopPropagation()` are called.
In this way, if the DOM changes after the safetap event is handled, the mobile browser's ghost click will not have effects.

In the sample below you can notice the differences in using `tap` or `safetap`, in a mobile browser (and the side effects of the ghost click when `safetap` is not handled):
